# Bug Bounty Hunting

Welcome to my Bug Bounty Hunting repository! This repository showcases my bug bounty hunting experiences and findings for various websites. 

## About Me
I am currently studying Cyber Security at SLIIT (Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology), and this assignment was completed as part of my second year, second-semester module on Web Security.

## Bug Bounty Hunting
In this project, I conducted bug bounty hunting for 10 different websites. During the process, I identified and reported security vulnerabilities to the respective organizations, promoting the improvement of their web security posture. The goal was to contribute to a safer online environment and enhance my practical skills in the field of cyber security.

Throughout the bug bounty hunting process, I focused on identifying common vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and insecure direct object references (IDOR), among others. I followed responsible disclosure practices by reporting my findings to the organizations and providing them with the necessary details to reproduce and fix the vulnerabilities.

Feel free to explore each directory to learn more about the specific vulnerabilities I discovered and reported for each website.

## Disclaimer
The vulnerabilities reported in this repository were disclosed responsibly to the respective organizations for remediation. The purpose of sharing this information is to promote awareness about web security and showcase my bug bounty hunting experiences. Please refrain from attempting any malicious activities based on the information provided in this repository.
